    "content": "So uh, meowdy! It's been a minute. So what have we been up to? To make a very long story short, this project became way bigger than we expected! Progress on CorGeo was slow for a bit while we figured out what direction we wanted to take the game in. And we had to pretty much re-build the whole game from the ground up since the old codebase was a mess. But things are back in full swing, and I am stupid excited for everyone to try out the new demo when it's ready! (Which will be soon-ish (probably...))"
