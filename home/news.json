    "content": "Errynei, Connorses, Alex, & I participated in the FGAD Game Jam #4! We created a spoooky game called Autumn Howl, where a small cat named Autumn attempts to defeat an evil beast out in the forest using a blade that's way too big for them! The game is available to play on the Games page or on itch.io. We plan to push out one more update to fix a bunch of bugs and balancing issues, as well as to add all the stuff we didn't have time for during the jam! No Idea when we'll be able to get that out though, since I'm ping-ponging between it and the CorGeo project. "

    "content": "So uh, meowdy! It's been a minute. So what have we been up to? To make a very long story short, this project became way bigger than we expected! Progress on CorGeo was slow for a bit while we figured out what direction we wanted to take the game in. And we had to pretty much re-build the whole game from the ground up since the old codebase was a mess. But things are back in full swing, and I am stupid excited for everyone to try out the new demo when it's ready! (Which will be soon-ish (probably...))"
